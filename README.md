# Melting Recipe Compatability

Hosts the files for my [datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/melting-recipe-compatibility) that adds some extra mod compat to Tinker's Construct's melting recipes. Also hosts the assets for both project pages.

Designed for my modpack, [The Essence of Everything: Quintessence](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe-2).

Report issues (and/or suggest mod support) [here](https://github.com/vizthex123/MeltingRecipeCompat/issues).
