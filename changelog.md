# Datapack Changelog

A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [Datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/melting-recipe-compatability).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support (so long as the addition has 8+ recipes), and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch.

Lines appended with a version in brackets (e.g. [1.19] Text Here) denote changes that only apply to that version.
