# Datapack Changelog

A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [Datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/melting-recipe-compatability).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support (so long as the addition has 8+ recipes), and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch.

Lines appended with a version in brackets (e.g. Text Here [1.19]) denote changes that only apply to that version.

--------------------------------------------------

# v2.1

Optimised a few recipes by combining them into a single entry
- Also fixed the incorrect melting temperatures in several recipes

Fixed all the melting times not using the proper time units
- For some reason, the mod uses a 4:1 time ratio (e.g. 12 time equals 3 seconds for the item to melt) instead of the standard 20:1 (20 ticks per second)

Fixed Bygone Nether's Gilded Netherite recipes not loading in<br />
Fixed the Obscuria's Essentials Paladin's Helmet using a Helmet instead<br />
Fixed the Oh The Biomes You'll Go recipe for Chainmail Boots using a Helmet instead<br />
Fixed the Oh The Biomes You'll Go recipe for Pendorite Horse Armour not loading in

Added a melting recipe for Crying Obsidian<br />
Added melting recipes for all of Blood Magic's anointments<br />
Added melting recipes for several other random items that I missed

Added support for the following mods:
- Additional Additions
- Bygone Nether
- Colds: Easy Paxel (and the Lite version)
- Oh the Biomes You'll Go
- Only Paxel
- Simple Paxels


<br /> <br />

--------------------------------------------------
# v2.0

Overhauled file structure so it's easier to add recipes
- This doesn't affect users, but is still worth noting

Added a melting recipe for Cast Iron Plates<br />
Fixed several Iron melting recipes using Cast Iron items<br />

Added Molten Slime to several melting recipes that were missing it<br />
