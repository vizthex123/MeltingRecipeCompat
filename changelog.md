# Datapack Changelog

A full changelog for every version (and sub-version) of the [Datapack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/data-packs/melting-recipe-compatibility).

This one will be updated more often than the CurseForge and Modrinth changelogs.

I increment the version by X.1 whenever I add more mod support (so long as the addition has 8+ recipes), and X.X.1 for minor fixes and/or additions I missed in the last patch.

Lines appended with a version in brackets (e.g. Text Here [1.19]) denote changes that only apply to that version.

--------------------------------------------------

# v2.2

Added Steam as a Smeltery fuel<br />
Made my custom tags use the `required` field, that way all of them can load in properly

Fixed Crying Obsidian and Respawn Anchors having the wrong melting temperature<br />
Fixed Amethyst Throwing Daggers outputting Gold instead of Copper (and not working with the Tipped Variant) [Blood Magic]<br />
Fixed Vertical Brick and Quartz Slabs not having melting recipes [Quark]<br />
Fixed some issues with XNet's connector recipes

Updated Create Deco support with all the Brick Blocks I missed (even though that's like half of the mod lol)<br />
Removed several unecessary tags (recipes have been updated to use the standard input substitution method):
- The `cage_lamps` tag. Also vastly reduced the melting time.
- The `connectors` tag. Also vastly reduced the melting time.

# v2.1

Optimised a few recipes by combining them into a single entry
- Also fixed the incorrect melting temperatures in several recipes

Fixed the Obscuria's Essentials Paladin's Helmet using a Helmet instead<br />
