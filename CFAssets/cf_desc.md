This datapack adds mod compat melting recipes to [Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct).

Originally designed for my modpack, [The Essence of Everything: Quintessence](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe-2).

I'll try to add support across all versions, but - as with all of my projects - my current focus is on 1.20.1. Feel free to suggest support I should add in the comments section, [issue tracker](https://github.com/vizthex123/MeltingRecipeCompat/issues), or [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NtwzA6X).

# Installation Instructions

1) After downloading the datapack, get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).

2) Place the datapack into `config/openloader/data`

3) When updating the datapack, repeat step 2 - just override the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.
