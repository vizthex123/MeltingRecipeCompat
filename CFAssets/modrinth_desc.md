This datapack adds mod compat melting recipes to [Tinker's Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct).

Originally designed for my modpack, [The Essence of Everything: Quintessence](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe-2).

Since the recipe syntax is the same for the 1.18 and 1.19 versions, any changes & additions will apply to both of them (provided the supported mods are available for that version).

<br />

# Installation Instructions

1) After downloading the datapack, get [Open Loader](https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader).

2) Place the datapack into `config/openloader/data`

3) When updating the datapack, repeat step 2 - just override the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.
