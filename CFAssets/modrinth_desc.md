This datapack adds mod support for melting recipes from [Tinker's Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct).

Designed for my modpack, [The Essence of Everything: Quintessence](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/teoe-2).

Since the recipe syntax is the same for the 1.18 and 1.19 versions, any changes & additions will apply to both of them (provided the supported mods are available for that version).

<br />

# Installation Instructions

1) After downloading the datapack, get [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader). *If you want the trivia entries, download the latest version of the [resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/extra-data-models-trivia) as well*

2) Place the datapack into `config/openloader/data`

3) When updating the datapack, repeat step 2 - just override the .zip with the new one and it'll update everything.

<br />

# Mod Support

*Mod support only loads in if the mod(s) are also loaded into the game, so you don't need to install all of these mods.*
